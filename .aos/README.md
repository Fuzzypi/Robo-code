# AOS Runtime Directory

This directory contains the runtime surface for the Agent Operating System (AOS).

It is intentionally separate from governance documents to prevent policy
from being modified by runtime state.

---

## Purpose

The `.aos/` directory defines:
- Where runtime state lives
- Where future tooling will write operational data
- How agents understand execution context

No enforcement logic exists in this directory in Phase 0.
